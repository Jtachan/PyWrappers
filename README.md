# PyWrappers

General wrappers and decorators to be used for debugging purposes.

Right now, the package is only a set of algorithms that I tend to use in small debugging tasks.
They don't require any heavy load for code or algorithm, but this way there is no need to always code them again.

There is no planning about releasing it any soon to PyPI.
If the package comes to be something, then I might consider it in the future.
